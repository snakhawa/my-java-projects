/**
 * Hashtable stors data, diff between HashSet and HashMap.
 * We wrote basic implementation of HashSet (add, Remove, Contains), HashTable (Get, Put)
 * Solved discussed 3 Interview problems
 * 1. Given an crackingthecode of integers, find if the crackingthecode contains any duplicates - Using HashSet and Sort
 * 2. Given an arrya of duplicates find single non duplicate number- Using Hashset, Sort and compare and XOR solution
 * 3. Intersection of 2 arrays - Using HashSet, Sort use 2 pointers, Sort and Binary Search
