/**
 * Median Stream
 * You're given a list of n integers arr[0..(n-1)]. You must compute a list output[0..(n-1)] such that,
 * for each index i (between 0 and n-1, inclusive), output[i] is equal to the median of the elements arr[0..i] (rounded down to the nearest integer).
 * The median of a list of integers is defined as follows.
 *
 *  If the integers were to be sorted, then:
 * If there are an odd number of integers, then the median is equal to the middle integer in the sorted order.
 * Otherwise, if there are an even number of integers,
 *
 * then the median is equal to the average of the two middle-most integers in the sorted order
 *
 * Example 1
 * n = 4
 * arr = [5, 15, 1, 3]
 * output = [5, 10, 5, 4]
 * The median of [5] is 5, the median of [5, 15] is (5 + 15) / 2 = 10, the median of [5, 15, 1] is 5, and the median of [5, 15, 1, 3] is (3 + 5) / 2 = 4.
